            This Final Design Project for the CSE 3132 Computer Networks course explores ten contemporary and critical problems within the seven layers of the OSI model, ranging from application to physical layers. Each problem is systematically analyzed, accompanied by comprehensive solutions utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer simulations and theoretical frameworks. The outcome is a meticulously prepared Administrative Guide Tutorial designed to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications.

            The project integrates recent advancements in networking technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and quantum networking, reflecting the evolving landscape of communication networks. Furthermore, the project website employs an interactive HTML-based navigation structure, enabling seamless access to problem descriptions and their respective solutions.

    <div class="section-title" id="osi-model">The OSI Reference Model</div>
    <p class="no-indent">
        The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific role in the communication process, facilitating interoperability and modular design in network systems. This project leverages the OSI model to analyze network challenges, with each article addressing issues at specific layers. Below is a brief overview of the seven layers:
    </p>
    <ul style="column-span: all;">
        <li><strong>Layer 7 – Application Layer:</strong> Provides network services directly to end-user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP). It handles user interfaces and data formatting.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 6 – Presentation Layer:</strong> Manages data translation, encryption, and compression to ensure data is presented correctly (e.g., SSL/TLS).</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 5 – Session Layer:</strong> Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications (e.g., RPC, NetBIOS).</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 4 – Transport Layer:</strong> Ensures reliable data transfer with error control and flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP).</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 3 – Network Layer:</strong> Handles logical addressing and routing of packets across networks (e.g., IP, ICMP).</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 2 – Data Link Layer:</strong> Provides node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction (e.g., Ethernet, PPP).</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 1 – Physical Layer:</strong> Defines the physical medium and electrical/optical signaling for data transmission (e.g., cables, fiber optics).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="no-indent">
        The OSI model’s layered approach allows for systematic troubleshooting and solution design, as demonstrated in the project’s articles. For instance, Article 2 addresses IP blocking issues at Layer 3, while considering impacts from Layers 4 and 7.
